### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Soodeh Mousavi asl

Currently, I'm studying B. Sc. Information Engineering at HAW Hamburg. Before that, I got my master's degree in the Science of Conservation and Restoration of Cultural Heritage From the University of Bologna, Italy. Very different, right? Because I really enjoy learning new things! After I studied and learned about the "Past", which was indeed very inspiring, I moved on to learn how to build a better "future". So, here I am...

Skills: MATLAB/MySQL/ C / JAVA / HTML5 / CSS/...

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning QA, C, JAVA 
- âš¡ Fun fact: The world is going to end if you follow your Fears instead of your Dreams ;)
